Apple faces class action lawsuit over the jelly scrolling issue on the iPad mini 6
The plaintiff accuses Apple of fraudulent marketing because it continues to sell the 2021 iPad mini 6 without fixing the jelly scrolling issue or disclosing it in its marketing materials.
Even as Samsung introduces his latest and greatest Android tablets in the Galaxy Tab S8 line, Apple's iPads remain the undisputed leader in this market segment. The rather lacking tablet competition also means that Apple may sometimes get away with releasing imperfect products like the latest iPad mini 6, which a man from Colorado now refuses to accept.

According to a report by MacRumors, Christopher Bryan has filed a class action lawsuit against Apple in the Northern California district court that revolves around the infamous jelly scrolling issue in the latest 6th generation iPad mini which was released last fall. It causes text lines to look uneven when scrolling through websites or documents while holding the compact tablet in portrait mode. He therefore accuses Apple of fraudulent marketing as the Cupertino-based company continues to sell the iPad mini 6 despite being aware of the jelly scrolling effect which Bryan actually calls a defect.

We reported on this aforementioned jelly scrolling issue back when it first surfaced in late 2021. Since then, Apple has officially acknowledged the issue, but it apparently claims that this is a perfectly normal behavior for LCD displays like the one in the iPad mini 6. Consequently, the issue still persists, which is why this class action lawsuit now seeks yet to be determined damages for every person in the US who bought a 6th generation iPad mini.
